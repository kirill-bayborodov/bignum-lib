# bignum-shift-right

A C library for arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic, focusing on high-performance right shift operations.

This project aims to implement an efficient right shift operation for large integers (bignums) with performance in mind, potentially utilizing assembly optimizations.

## Getting Started

This repository provides the initial project structure for the `bignum-shift-right` library. Further development will involve adding core logic, unit tests, and comprehensive build instructions.
